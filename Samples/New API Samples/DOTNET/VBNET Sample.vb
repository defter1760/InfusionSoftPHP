'VB.NET sample Created on 7/7/08 by: Justin Morris
'This VB.NET sample will create a contact record in Infusionsoft 
'and based on check boxes add it to groups and/or campaigns.
'For this example you will need a windows forms project
'with 4 text boxes (fName, lName, eMail and Results - Results I have set as multiline.
'You will also need 4 check boxes: news1, news2, camp1 and camp2.
'And finally 1 button named addCon.

'start off by adding CookComputing.XmlRpcV2.dll as a project reference - you can download the file from
'www.xml-rpc.net.

'now lets import the cook computing xmlrpc library.
